A self hosted alternative to notebookLM to accelerate learning/research with AI

### How it works:
Using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to act as a backend, you can upload documents or links to videos/websites which are then embedded and used as context for the model of your choice to chat with or create a 'podcast' to listen to the key points of the resources.

### TODO:
 - Add functionality
