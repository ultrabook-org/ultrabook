#### About
Ultrabook uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [Chroma](https://trychroma.com/) to create a RAG pipeline that lets you chat to your documents! It is a great tool to accelerate research and learning; for example, you might get your chosen model to quiz you on a topic or create the basic structure of essays or other writing, all while keeping your data on device and private.
